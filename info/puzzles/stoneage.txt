Stoneage Puzzle

This puzzle is an accurate replication of the classic DOS game Stone Age,
released in 1992. The puzzle area consists of various elements, including
a start cell, a finish cell, floors, walls, sands, paired portals, keys,
locks, void cells, and directional lifts. Each element adds unique
mechanics to the challenge.

The character can freely travel through floor cells. Sand cells are
traversable once and transform into void cells upon exit, requiring
careful planning. Portals and directional lifts allow access to otherwise
unreachable areas, while keys of two distinct types can be collected and
used to unlock corresponding locks. Directional lifts are the only way to
cross void cells.

Strategic use of these mechanics is essential to navigate through the
puzzle and access the finish cell. The combination of diverse elements
makes this puzzle both challenging and nostalgic for fans of the original
game.

Goal: Reach the finish by utilizing the environment and its mechanics.
