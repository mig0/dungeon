Rotatepic Puzzle

This puzzle involves restoring a large image that has been divided into
square mini-image cells. Each cell is randomly rotated by 0, 90, 180, or
270 degrees at the start. Your task is to rotate all mini-image cells to
return them to their correct orientation and recreate the original image.

The puzzle can be navigated and manipulated using various controls. With
the keyboard, you can use the arrow keys to navigate to a cell and Space
or PageDown (or PageUp) to rotate it clockwise (or counter-clockwise).
The cells may be similarly navigated and rotated with PlayStation
controller. For mouse users, clicking on a cell rotates it clockwise or
anti-clockwise depending on the mouse button used.

Goal: Rotate all mini-image cells to restore the original image.
